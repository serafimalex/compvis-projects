HOW TO RUN:
1) Run all cells of Parking.ipynb. Only task 1 has been implemented. Thus, only folder 'Task1' is created.
2) Input tests are expected in the 'test' folder. If file structure differs, change value of 'test_path' in the last cell.
3) Output is written to 'submission_files/407_Serafim_Alex'. If this should differ, change value of 'results_path' in the last cell.
